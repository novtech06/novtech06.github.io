GOMOA true type font by P.D. Magnuswww.fontmonkey.comGomo is a font based on the title of Gomo*Fasta, a strategy game which Idesigned. The game is a variant of Go Moku, so the font is intended tohave an oriental feel. I designed the logo in Freehand and adapted theTrueType font using PfaEdit. There are alpha caps plus numerals and afew random punctuation marks.Gomo*Fasta is available at http://www.magnusludus.comThis font is copyright 2002 by P.D. Magnus.
